# Encapsulation Practice Project

This project aims to demonstrate the concept of encapsulation and inheritance in object-oriented programming (OOP) using a simple example of a car information system.

## Overview

The project consists of three classes:

1. **CarInfo**: This class represents basic information about a car, including its plate number, production year, and owner's name.
2. **Car**: This class inherits from the CarInfo class and extends it by adding additional attributes such as color, speed, and motor power. It also encapsulates the properties of the car such as year and brand to ensure data integrity.
3. **Form1**: This is a Windows Forms application that demonstrates the usage of the Car class by creating an instance of it and displaying its information using a message box.

## File Structure

## Getting Started

To run the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the solution file (`EncapsulationPractice.sln`) in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project.

## Usage

When you run the project, a Windows Forms application will open. Clicking the button in the form will create an instance of the Car class, set its properties, and display its information in a message box.
